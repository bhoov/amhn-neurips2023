We invite submissions on novel research results (theoretical and empirical),
software frameworks and abstractions, benchmarks, demos, visualizations, and
work-in-progress research. The format of submissions is **4-page papers** (
excluding references) submitted to [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=NeurIPS.cc/2023/Workshop/AMHN). The reviews will not be shared publicly.

## Scope

The research topics of interest at this workshop include (but are not limited
to):

- Novel architectures for associative memory, Hopfield Networks, Dense
  Associative Memories, and related models.
- Hybrid memory augmented architectures, e.g., memory augmented Transformers and
  RNNs, networks with fast weight updates.
- Energy-based models and their applications.
- Training algorithms for energy-based, or memory-based architectures.
- The connection between associative memory and neuroscience (both insights from
  neuroscience for better AI, and AI-inspired neurobiological work).
- Kernel methods and associative memories.
- Theoretical properties of associative memories with insights from statistical
  physics, contraction analysis, control theory, etc.
- Multimodal architectures with associative memories.
- Sequential Hopfield networks for temporal sequences.
- Clustering with associative memories.
- Energy-based Transformers.
- Applications of associative memories and energy-based models to various data
  domains, such as language, images, sound, graphs, temporal sequences,
  computational chemistry and biology, etc.

## Submission

The OpenReview submission is now open: [link](https://openreview.net/group?id=NeurIPS.cc/2023/Workshop/AMHN)

The submission deadline is: September 29 2023 23:59 AOE

The format of submissions is 4-page papers (+ references) using the workshop’s
[LaTeX template](/amhn2023_latex_template.zip "download"). Supplementary materials / appendices after the references
are allowed and do not count towards the page limit. Submissions should be
anonymized and should not include any identifying information about author
identities or affiliations. There are no formal proceedings generated from this
workshop. Accepted papers will be made public on OpenReview. The reviewing
process will be double-blind. In assessing submitted contributions we will use
the same rules for conflicts of interest as are used in the main track NeurIPS
conference, e.g. reviewers cannot be from the same organization as authors,
recent coauthors cannot review each other’s submissions. While we welcome short
versions of published papers, preference will be given to new and not yet
published work.
