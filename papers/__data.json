The reviews will not be shared publicly.\n\n## Scope\n\nAssociative memory is defined as a network that can link a set of features into high-dimensional vectors, called memories. Prompted by a large enough subset of features taken from one memory, an animal or an AI network with an associative memory can retrieve the rest of the features belonging to that memory. The diverse human cognitive abilities which involve making appropriate responses to stimulus patterns can often be understood as the operation of an associative memory, with the memories often being distillations and consolidations of multiple experiences rather than merely corresponding to a single event.\n\nIn the world of artificial neural networks, a canonical mathematical model of this phenomenon is the Hopfield network ([Hopfield, 1982](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.79.8.2554)). Although often narrowly viewed as a model that can store and retrieve predefined verbatim memories of past events, its contemporary variants make it possible to store consolidated memories turning individual experiences into useful representations of the training data. Such modern variants are often trained using the backpropagation algorithm and often benefit from superior memory storage properties ([Krotov & Hopfield, 2016](https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/2016/hash/eaae339c4d89fc102edd9dbdb6a28915-Abstract.html)). Contemporary Hopfield networks can be used as submodules in larger AI networks solving a diverse set of tasks. The goal of this workshop is to discuss the existing and emerging developments of these ideas.
